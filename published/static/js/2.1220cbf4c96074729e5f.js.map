used to quickly apply a set\r\n * of property values. (set state)\r\n *\r\n * When [[Sprite]] (or any object that extends Sprite) is created it creates a\r\n * \"default\" state. You can modify the \"default\" state so that when the Sprite\r\n * returns to default state certain properties are added.\r\n *\r\n * Default state can be accessed using Sprite's `defaultState` getter.\r\n *\r\n * ```TypeScript\r\n * sprite.defaultState.properties.fillOpacity = 0.5;\r\n * ```\r\n * ```JavaScript\r\n * sprite.defaultState.properties.fillOpacity = 0.5;\r\n * ```\r\n * ```JSON\r\n * {\r\n *   // ...\r\n *   \"defaultState\": {\r\n *     \"properties\": {\r\n *       \"fillOpacity\": 0.5\r\n *     }\r\n *   }\r\n * }\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * If Sprite is \"hoverable\", it automatically adds a \"hover\" state, which is\r\n * applied when it has a cursor over it.\r\n *\r\n * ```TypeScript\r\n * let hoverstate = sprite.states.create(\"hover\");\r\n * hoverstate.properties.fillOpacity = 1;\r\n * ```\r\n * ```JavaScript\r\n * var hoverstate = sprite.states.create(\"hover\");\r\n * hoverstate.properties.fillOpacity = 1;\r\n * ```\r\n * ```JSON\r\n * {\r\n *   // ...\r\n *   \"states\": {\r\n *     \"hover\": {\r\n *       \"properties\": {\r\n *         \"fillOpacity\": 0.5\r\n *       }\r\n *     }\r\n *   }\r\n * }\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * The above will automatically apply \"hover\" state when the Sprite is hovered,\r\n * thus will set its `fillOpacity` property to 1, and will reset it to 0.5 when\r\n * it's no longer hovered.\r\n *\r\n * Every object that inherits from [[Sprite]] can and will add their own\r\n * properties to the available list.\r\n *\r\n * User can create their own states, and apply them as needed:\r\n *\r\n * ```TypeScript\r\n * let myCustomState = sprite.states.create(\"mystate\");\r\n * myCustomState.properties.fillOpacity = 0.5;\r\n * myCustomState.properties.strokeOpacity = 0.8;\r\n * sprite.setState(\"mystate\");\r\n * ```\r\n * ```JavaScript\r\n * var myCustomState = sprite.states.create(\"mystate\");\r\n * myCustomState.properties.fillOpacity = 0.5;\r\n * myCustomState.properties.strokeOpacity = 0.8;\r\n * sprite.setState(\"mystate\");\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * @see {@link https://www.amcharts.com/docs/v4/concepts/states/}\r\n * @important\r\n */\r\nvar SpriteState = /** @class */ (function (_super) {\r\n    tslib_1.__extends(SpriteState, _super);\r\n    /**\r\n     * Constructor\r\n     */\r\n    function SpriteState() {\r\n        var _this = \r\n        // Init\r\n        _super.call(this) || this;\r\n        /**\r\n         * Holds Adapter.\r\n         *\r\n         * @type {Adapter<Sprite, SpriteAdapters>}\r\n         */\r\n        _this.adapter = new Adapter(_this);\r\n        /**\r\n         * Duration of the transition to this state. 0 means instantenous transition.\r\n         * Any number means the [[Sprite]] will transit smoothly to this state,\r\n         * animating all animatable properties.\r\n         *\r\n         * @default 0\r\n         * @see {@link https://www.amcharts.com/docs/v4/concepts/animations/} for more info about animations\r\n         * @type {number}\r\n         */\r\n        _this.transitionDuration = 0;\r\n        /**\r\n         * Easing function to use when transitioning to this state.\r\n         *\r\n         * @default cubicOut\r\n         * @see {@link Ease}\r\n         * @see {@link https://www.amcharts.com/docs/v4/concepts/animations/} for more info about animations\r\n         * @type {(number) => number}\r\n         */\r\n        _this.transitionEasing = $ease.cubicOut;\r\n        /**\r\n         * Collection of properties and their values that should be applied to [[Sprite]]\r\n         * when switching to this State.\r\n         *\r\n         * The property values set on a [[SpriteState]] will override the ones set\r\n         * directly on a [[Sprite]].\r\n         *\r\n         * @type {Dictionary<string, any>}\r\n         */\r\n        _this.properties = {};\r\n        /**\r\n         * A collection of key/value pairs that can be used to bind specific Sprite\r\n         * properties to [[DataItem]].\r\n         *\r\n         * For example: `fill` property can be bound to `myCustomColor` field in\r\n         * DataItem.
